# Is It Fire?

## Description

This project was made for the Boreal Express Hackathon as one of my daily ships. It was made to help fellow hackers verify their ideas and determine if they met the hackathon's criteria of being: is it "wow", is it useful and is it inspired by the environment. It's a silly little porject but it helped me learn about NLP (Natural Language Processing) using the SpaCy library. The results are quite tame as the dataset is lacking severly as it is primarily composed of ChatGPT generated text and a couple of my fellow hackers. 

## Installation
